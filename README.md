# GSHP_potential README
This repository holds code for calculating the shallow geothermal potential as presented in a mansucript submitted to Geothermics. 
It includes:
- A python code for calculating steady state g-functions (gfunction) for a given borehole array (needs X,Y coodinates and borehole depth as input). 
- A R code for calculating the shallow geothermal potential per parcel (shallow geothermal). Needed inputs are described in the code.
